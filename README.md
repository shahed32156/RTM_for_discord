RTM stands for Requirement Traceability matrix. RTM maps all the requirements with the test cases. By using this document one can verify test cases cover all functionality of the application as per the requirements of the customer.

**Requirements:** Requirements of a particular project from the client. 
**Traceability:** The ability to trace the tests.
**Matrix:** The data which can be stored in rows and columns form.

The main purpose of the requirement traceability matrix is to verify that the all requirements of clients are covered in the test cases designed by the testers.
In simple words, one can say it is a pen and pencil approach i.e., to analyze the two data information but here we are using an Excel sheet to verify the data in a requirement traceability matrix.

Here's a professionally formatted Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM) for the Discord website, including 10 requirements.
